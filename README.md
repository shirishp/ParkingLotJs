## A template project for TDD workshop in JavaScript

This template project uses [Jasmine] (http://jasmine.github.io/)

Following are the stories we can use for the workshop

- As a driver, I want to park my car, So that I can catch my flight
- As a driver, I want to find my car, So that I can go home
- As a driver, I want to unpark my car, So that I can go home
- As a parking lot owner, I want to know when the lot is full, So that I can put out the full sign
- As a parking lot owner, I want to know when the parking lot has space again, So that I can take in the full sign
- As a parking lot owner, I want a parking attendant to park cars, So that I can make decisions on where to park the cars
